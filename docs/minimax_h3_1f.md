# MiniMax-H3 One-Frame (Image) Generation

> [!WARNING]
> This mode is **experimental**. The released MiniMax-H3 checkpoints were trained on 5-15 second videos; one-frame generation drives them with a single-token target (`T_lat=1`), which is outside the release distribution but works well in practice: plain one-frame T2VA produces high-quality photographic and illustrated images with the FL2VA base, and Ref2VA with a single image reference generates novel views of the referenced subject. See `docs/minimax_h3.md` for the shared setup (models, training recipes, memory options) and `docs/minimax_h3_advanced.md` for the internals.

## Overview

`--video_length 1` switches `minimax_h3_generate_video.py` into one-frame mode:

- The target is one video latent token plus the two audio latent frames the joint layout requires. The audio is a byproduct and is never decoded; the output is a PNG (`--save_path` must use `.png`).
- The single-token VAE decode duplicates the latent to a pseudo two-token clip and keeps pixel frame 0 (a solo token decode breaks down; the duplication decodes within ~1-2 dB of a true two-token decode). This happens inside the VAE automatically.
- All tasks are available: `t2va` (plain image), `fl2va` with one or more condition images (editing/inbetween-style probes; one or two is the released API, three or more is experimental), and `ref2va` (reference-driven images, including single-image novel-view generation).
- `--trajectory_dir` writes per-step PNGs instead of per-step videos.
- Standalone `audio` references are rejected in one-frame mode (their window is defined by the target duration, which a single frame does not have); video references keep their embedded audio.
- The released 5-15 s duration gate does not apply; `--allow_experimental_duration` is not needed.

Training on one-frame targets is available for plain image LoRA (T2VA), for editing/inbetween LoRA with time-annotated control images (FL2VA), and for reference-conditioned image LoRA (Ref2VA); see [One-frame training](#one-frame-training-t2va-image-lora), [One-frame editing training](#one-frame-editing-training-fl2va-control-images), and [One-frame reference training](#one-frame-reference-training-ref2va-image-references) below.

## Time semantics: `--one_frame_inference`

```text
--one_frame_inference "target_index=N,control_index=A;B"
```

(`--of` in prompt lines, for both the generation CLI's `--from_file`/`--interactive` modes and training-time samples. The cache scripts and the trainer have a `--one_frame` flag of their own that enables one-frame *training*; the generation option is named like the other architectures' `--one_frame_inference` to keep the two apart.)

Positions on H3's rotary time axis are expressed as **0-based 24 fps pixel-frame indices** on a nominal timeline (one pixel frame = 5/3 rotary units = 1/24 s). All times are relative to the target-block cursor, which itself moves with the text length — only relative placement carries meaning.

- `target_index` (default 0) places the generated frame.
- `control_index` places the FL2VA condition images, in `--condition_image` order (or `--first_frame`, `--last_frame`), `;`-separated. It is required when condition images are present and rejected otherwise.
- There is no separate duration parameter: "frame 24 of a 10-second video" is `control_index=0;240` with `target_index=24`.

The base model reads these times as a real signal: an FL2VA anchor at the target's exact time is reproduced almost verbatim (anchor snapping), and intermediate positions interpolate when the caption follows the official alignment-line prompt format. For plain T2VA the index is nearly inert for the base model but remains a trainable input.

## Plain image generation (T2VA)

```bash
python minimax_h3_generate_video.py \
  --task t2va \
  --dit /models/minimax_h3_fl2va_bf16.safetensors \
  --video_vae /models/minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors \
  --audio_vae /models/minimax_h3_audio_vae_fp32.safetensors \
  --text_encoder /models/qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3_bf16.safetensors \
  --prompt "A watercolor lighthouse at dusk." \
  --video_size 1024 1024 \
  --video_length 1 \
  --infer_steps 30 --seed 42 \
  --blocks_to_swap 48 \
  --save_path output.png
```

## Conditioned images (FL2VA, one or more pictures)

One-frame FL2VA takes an **ordered list of condition images**: the repeatable `--condition_image` (`--ci` in prompt lines), or `--first_frame` / `--last_frame` as aliases for the first two slots (the two forms cannot be mixed). The pictures are numbered `<Picture i>` in list order and placed on the time axis by `control_index` in the same order; unlike video FL2VA there are no "first"/"last" roles in one-frame mode — a slot's meaning comes from its time alone, so a lone `--last_frame` is still `<Picture 1>`.

One or two pictures is officially in-distribution for the FL2VA checkpoint (its released API takes zero, one, or two pictures). **Three or more pictures is experimental**: community reports show the FL2VA model reads additional pictures as further timed anchors (e.g. first, middle, last) at inference, and Musubi Tuner exposes the same layout for generation and training; effects on quality are yours to verify.

```bash
# generate "frame 24" of a nominal clip anchored by one condition image at frame 0
... --task fl2va --video_length 1 \
  --first_frame anchor.png \
  --one_frame_inference "target_index=24,control_index=0" \
  --prompt "..." --save_path frame24.png

# three anchors: frames 0, 48 and 96, generating frame 24 (experimental)
... --task fl2va --video_length 1 \
  --condition_image a.png --condition_image b.png --condition_image c.png \
  --one_frame_inference "target_index=24,control_index=0;48;96" \
  --prompt "..." --save_path frame24.png
```

For best results the caption should follow the official alignment-line formats from the prompt-writing guide (I2VA/L2VA/FL2VA opening lines); the base model reads condition times far more continuously with official-format captions than with plain ones.

## Reference-driven images (Ref2VA)

Ref2VA one-frame combines with inline `--ref` references (see `docs/minimax_h3.md`):

```bash
... --task ref2va --dit /models/minimax_h3_ref2va_bf16.safetensors \
  --video_length 1 \
  --ref character.png \
  --prompt "..." --save_path view.png
```

With a full-reference-style caption, a single image reference yields novel views of the referenced subject (front/side/back selectable by text) with the environment plausibly extended — useful for synthesizing character-LoRA training data. Note that for dense 2D illustrations the reference is re-drawn rather than preserved pixel-exactly, and unseen-angle environments are plausible inventions, not geometry.

Audio-bearing video references are accepted and keep their own duration; combining them with a one-frame target is untested territory.

## One-frame training (T2VA image LoRA)

> [!WARNING]
> Experimental, like the rest of this mode. The single-token target is outside the released training distribution; quality expectations come from the one-frame generation results above, and image-trained LoRAs applied to video generation are unvalidated territory.

`--one_frame` on the two cache scripts and the trainer enables plain image LoRA training: each image becomes a single-token video target with a silence audio placeholder. The FL2VA base checkpoint with `--task t2va` is the normal choice, mirroring plain one-frame generation.

### Dataset configuration

Image datasets use the standard image keys. `fp_1f_target_index` (optional, default 0) places the target on the rotary time axis, in the same 0-based 24 fps pixel-frame indices as generation's `--one_frame_inference target_index=N`; for plain image LoRA the default is fine. Control images and `fp_1f_clean_indices` belong to the FL2VA editing mode (next section); `multiple_target` is not supported.

```toml
[general]
resolution = [1024, 1024]
batch_size = 1
enable_bucket = true
bucket_no_upscale = false

[[datasets]]
image_directory = "/data/h3/images"
cache_directory = "/data/h3/cache-images"
caption_extension = ".txt"
```

`image_jsonl_file` works as usual (`image_path` + `caption` per line). Buckets snap to the 32-pixel H3 grid. Image and video datasets may share one TOML but must not share a `cache_directory`.

Captions should follow the official T2VA caption format where possible. Because every one-frame item carries silent audio rows (excluded from supervision), it is recommended to state the absence of sound explicitly in the caption (for example a `sound:`-style field describing it as a silent still) so the text stays consistent with what the model sees — this likely also helps the LoRA transfer to normal video generation, where audio is live.

### Caching

```bash
python minimax_h3_cache_latents.py \
  --dataset_config /data/h3/images.toml \
  --task t2va --one_frame \
  --video_vae /models/minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors \
  --audio_vae /models/minimax_h3_audio_vae_fp32.safetensors \
  --cache_seed 42 --skip_existing

python minimax_h3_cache_text_encoder_outputs.py \
  --dataset_config /data/h3/images.toml \
  --task t2va --one_frame \
  --text_encoder /models/qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3_bf16.safetensors \
  --skip_existing
```

Each latent cache holds the single-token target (`[24,1,H/16,W/16]`, seeded posterior like video targets), the constant 2-frame silence audio latent (`audio_present=0`, encoded once per run), and the target index as a tensor entry. Text caches are plain T2VA presentations of the caption — time indices never enter the text, so changing `fp_1f_target_index` re-caches latents (cheap) but not text. The duration gate does not apply; `--allow_experimental_duration` is not needed.

### Training

```bash
accelerate launch --num_cpu_threads_per_process 1 --mixed_precision bf16 minimax_h3_train_network.py \
  --dataset_config /data/h3/images.toml \
  --task t2va --one_frame \
  --dit /models/minimax_h3_fl2va_bf16.safetensors \
  --network_module networks.lora_minimax_h3 --network_dim 16 \
  --video_only \
  ... # remaining flags as in docs/minimax_h3.md
```

- **One of the three loss methods of `docs/minimax_h3.md` is mandatory for one-frame training.** With the plain flow target alone, de-distillation drift surfaces within ~50 steps as structural degradation — wobbly lines and broken proportions, like low-CFG output of an undistilled model — rather than the washout seen in video training (image steps average over far fewer target rows and repeat a small dataset quickly). A training adapter (`--base_weights`) or the guidance loss (`--h3_guidance_loss_scale 4.0 --h3_guidance_loss_sigma_min 0.15` with an uncond cache) restores clean structure; a short LR warmup (e.g. 50 steps) also helps the early phase. For character identity LoRAs with per-item references there is a third option, the subject-reference teacher (see [One-frame reference training](#one-frame-reference-training-ref2va-image-references)). Editing and reference training below take the adapter or the guidance loss.
- `--video_only` is recommended for image-only runs: the silence placeholders are excluded from audio supervision by presence gating either way, so the audio loss would always be 0.
- Steps are much cheaper than video steps (a 1 MP image is a few hundred target rows); with block swap active, per-step time is dominated by weight streaming rather than compute.
- Mixed image+video training in one run is expected to work (`--one_frame` only adds acceptance of one-frame batches; video batches are unaffected) but is untested — treat it as experimental.
- Training-time samples under a merged `--base_weights` adapter show the de-distilled model and are not representative; evaluate with the generation CLI on the plain base + LoRA.

Training-time samples support one-frame outputs: `--f 1` in a sample prompt line switches that sample to a PNG (audio is never decoded), and `--of target_index=N` optionally places it on the time axis:

```text
A watercolor lighthouse at dusk. --w 1024 --h 1024 --f 1 --s 30 --d 42
```

The LoRA metadata records `ss_minimax_h3_one_frame` for provenance. The resulting LoRA loads into generation as usual (one-frame or video).

## One-frame editing training (FL2VA, control images)

> [!WARNING]
> Experimental. This trains the base model's timed-anchor pathway directly; read the index guidance below before building a dataset.

With `--task fl2va`, an image dataset pairs each target image with one or more **time-annotated control images**: the controls become FL2VA condition latents (and `<Picture i>` visuals in the text presentation), and their positions on the rotary time axis come from the dataset config. This trains editing LoRAs (control = source image, target = edited image) and inbetween/中割り LoRAs (controls = endpoint frames, target = an intermediate frame; optionally with additional intermediate anchors, see below).

### Dataset configuration

```toml
[[datasets]]
image_directory = "/data/h3/edit/targets"
control_directory = "/data/h3/edit/sources"
cache_directory = "/data/h3/cache-edit"
caption_extension = ".txt"
fp_1f_clean_indices = [0]     # control image positions (24 fps pixel-frame indices)
fp_1f_target_index = 24       # target position — REQUIRED when controls are present
```

- `control_directory` matches controls to targets by filename (`image.png` ↔ `image.png` / `image_0.png`), or use `image_jsonl_file` with `control_path` (or `control_path_0`/`control_path_1`) per line. `fp_1f_clean_indices` is what makes the controls timed FL2VA anchors; the same control images without indices are untimed Ref2VA references instead (see the reference training section below).
- `fp_1f_clean_indices` gives one index per control image, in control order (`image_0.png` / `control_path_0` first): the controls become the ordered condition slots `cond_000`, `cond_001`, ... and `<Picture 1>`, `<Picture 2>`, ... in the same order. A slot has no time meaning of its own — only the indices do. Any number of controls is accepted; one or two matches the released FL2VA API, **three or more is experimental** (a first/middle/last triple for inbetween training, for example) and its benefit should be checked with an A/B against the two-anchor form.
- Both `fp_1f_clean_indices` and an explicit `fp_1f_target_index` are required when time-annotated controls are present; there are no defaults. Controls are resized to the target's bucket resolution.
- The alpha channel of RGBA control images is ignored (dropped before both VAE and text-encoder processing) — unlike FramePack one-frame training, it does not act as a mask.
- Time-order is unconstrained: an anchor **after** the target (`fp_1f_clean_indices = [120]`, `fp_1f_target_index = 24`) trains an L2VA-style LoRA (generate the image that precedes an end state). Generation fits condition images to the canvas the same way training fits controls to the bucket (scale to cover, center crop), so the LoRA sees its conditions preprocessed identically; the released Diffusers pipeline instead stretches its first picture onto the canvas.

### Choosing indices

The base model's strongest prior is **verbatim anchor copying at coinciding timestamps**: a control whose index equals the target index is reproduced almost exactly, so such a dataset trains head-on against copying — only do this when copy-at-the-anchor is the desired behavior. The recommended starting recipe for editing is `fp_1f_clean_indices = [0]`, `fp_1f_target_index = 24` (a one-second separation); inference must then use the same relative placement (`--one_frame_inference "target_index=24,control_index=0"`). For inbetween triplets extracted from real videos, use the real frame distances: (first@0, last@N, target@αN) → `fp_1f_clean_indices = [0, N]`, `fp_1f_target_index = round(αN)`. Since the indices live in the dataset config, one α per dataset block; several blocks can share a TOML.

**Captions must follow the official alignment-line formats** (I2VA/L2VA/FL2VA opening lines from the prompt-writing guide): plain captions actively suppress the base model's continuous reading of condition times, which is exactly the pathway this training relies on.

### Caching and training

Same commands as plain image training with `--task fl2va` instead of `--task t2va` on both cache scripts and the trainer. The latent cache additionally holds the condition latents (`latents_cond_000`, `latents_cond_001`, ... in control order) and the control indices as a tensor entry; the text cache embeds the bucket-resized control images in the FL2VA presentation. Changing `fp_1f_target_index` or `fp_1f_clean_indices` re-caches latents only (`--skip_existing` detects it); changing control image files re-caches both. One-frame FL2VA latent caches written before the ordered `cond_` slots (they used `latents_first`/`latents_last`) are rebuilt automatically by `--skip_existing`, and the trainer rejects them with a re-cache hint if they are used as-is.

The loss-method requirement from plain image training applies unchanged: a training adapter or the guidance loss (teacher matching does not apply, since its student is always `--task t2va`). Training-time samples mirror the generation CLI: provide the condition image(s) and the placement per prompt line:

```text
Official-format caption... --w 1024 --h 1024 --f 1 --s 30 --i source.png --of target_index=24,control_index=0
Official-format caption... --w 1024 --h 1024 --f 1 --s 30 --ci a.png --ci b.png --ci c.png --of target_index=24,control_index=0;48;96
```

(`--ci` is the ordered condition list, repeatable; `--i` / `--ei` alias its first two slots and cannot be mixed with `--ci`; `control_index` takes one `;`-separated entry per condition image, and is required.)

## One-frame reference training (Ref2VA, image references)

> [!WARNING]
> Experimental. This is the training counterpart of one-frame Ref2VA generation: each image target is conditioned on its own ordered references, presented exactly as at inference (numbered reference blocks before the target, `<Picture i>`/`<Video i>` visuals in the text).

With `--task ref2va`, an image dataset pairs each target image with **untimed references** (the same reference schema as video Ref2VA: images, videos with or without audio). Typical uses are identity/character LoRAs trained on (reference image → target image) pairs of the same subject, where the reference is a *different* picture than the target, view-synthesis or restyling pairs, and composition tasks that assemble a target from several pictures (a character, a pose, a background).

Both released transformer families respond to the reference presentation with a one-frame target: the Ref2VA checkpoint by design, and the FL2VA checkpoint extracts a referenced subject's identity about as well (measured with the generation CLI). Training `--task ref2va` on the FL2VA base is therefore a legitimate choice when the LoRA should be deployed with the FL2VA/T2VA weights; note that the LoRA metadata records `ss_minimax_h3_base_family=ref2va` from the task in that case.

### Dataset configuration

References come from one of two places:

**Per-record `references` in `image_jsonl_file`** (images, videos, audio-bearing videos; relative reference paths resolve from the JSONL directory, as in the video Ref2VA JSONL; `image_path` follows the usual image JSONL rules):

```toml
[[datasets]]
image_jsonl_file = "/data/h3/char/items.jsonl"
cache_directory = "/data/h3/cache-char-ref"
# fp_1f_target_index is optional (default 0); references carry no time index
```

```json
{"image_path": "/data/h3/char/targets/pose_01.png", "caption": "...", "references": [{"type": "image", "path": "refs/front.png"}]}
{"image_path": "/data/h3/char/targets/pose_02.png", "caption": "...", "references": [{"type": "image", "path": "refs/front.png"}, {"type": "video", "path": "refs/turnaround.mp4"}]}
```

**Control images without `fp_1f_clean_indices`**, the ordinary "target + n control images" dataset shape: `control_directory` (`target.png` ↔ `target_0.png`, `target_1.png`, ...) or `control_path` / `control_path_0`, `control_path_1`, ... in `image_jsonl_file`. Each control image becomes one image reference, in index order (`<Picture 1>` = control 0). This suits composition datasets such as (character picture, pose picture, background picture → composed target):

```toml
[[datasets]]
image_directory = "/data/h3/compose/targets"
control_directory = "/data/h3/compose/parts"   # target.png <- target_0.png (character), target_1.png (pose), target_2.png (background)
cache_directory = "/data/h3/cache-compose"
caption_extension = ".txt"
# no fp_1f_clean_indices: the controls are untimed references, not FL2VA anchors
```

- Every record needs at least one image or video reference (the video Ref2VA limits apply: at most 9 images, 3 videos, 3 audio-bearing references). Standalone `audio` references are rejected, as in one-frame generation; video references keep their embedded audio (or an explicit `audio_path`, or `"audio_path": null` for visual-only).
- A record cannot have both `references` and control images; a dataset with `fp_1f_clean_indices` is an FL2VA dataset and cannot be cached with `--task ref2va`.
- Whether a picture is a reference or an FL2VA control is a real difference for the model, not just a data-layout choice: references are untimed subject/appearance conditions presented in the reference format (the base's prior is to transfer what the picture shows), while FL2VA controls are timed anchors on the target timeline (the base's prior is to copy the anchor at its time). For "edit this source image" tasks the FL2VA route matches the official editing pathway; for "assemble the target from these parts" tasks use references.
- Image references are canvas-capped to the target's bucket area (downscale only); video references keep their full released span (15 s cap at 24 fps, 2 fps text sampling), exactly like one-frame generation.
- Captions should follow the official full-reference caption format (the reference-declaration lines from the prompt-writing guide), which is what makes single-image references yield novel views at inference; the same captions are used for training-time samples.

### Caching and training

Same commands as plain image training with `--task ref2va` on both cache scripts and the trainer. The latent cache holds the target token, the silence placeholder, the target index, and the reference condition latents under the numbered `latents_ref_{i:03d}_{image|video|audio}` keys of video Ref2VA caches; the text cache holds the Ref2VA presentation with the reference visuals embedded. Changing a reference file re-caches both.

```bash
python minimax_h3_cache_latents.py --dataset_config items.toml --task ref2va --one_frame ...
python minimax_h3_cache_text_encoder_outputs.py --dataset_config items.toml --task ref2va --one_frame ...
accelerate launch ... minimax_h3_train_network.py --dataset_config items.toml --task ref2va --one_frame --video_only ...
```

The loss-method requirement from plain image training applies unchanged: a training adapter or the guidance loss (the uncond probe keeps the reference conditions and swaps only the text rows). The same `--task ref2va` latent caches also feed the **subject-reference teacher** for a text-only student — the recipe for a character LoRA that is used without references at inference (`--task t2va --one_frame --h3_teacher_matching --h3_teacher_conditions subject_ref`, the only teacher-matching mode available with `--one_frame`; the text cache is then written with `--task t2va --one_frame --teacher_conditions subject_ref`). It needs no adapter and no guidance loss: the teacher's prediction carries the base's own guidance amplification. The recipe is in the Training section of `docs/minimax_h3.md`; the mechanism and the data contract (`teacher_caption`, the `<Subject 1>` trigger) are in `docs/minimax_h3_advanced.md`. Training-time samples use the inline `--ref` syntax with `--f 1`:

```text
Full-reference caption... --w 1024 --h 1024 --f 1 --s 30 --ref refs/front.png --of target_index=0
```
